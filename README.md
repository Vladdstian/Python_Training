## My Personal Computer Science Bootcamp!

### Welcome to my personal Bootcamp repository! 
It has been created specifically for me to help me learn computer science skills and improve my coding abilities or learn them as a beginner. I will go through various courses and certifications in order to learn more of this field.

### Tools:
- VIM - I will be using Vim as the main code editor (because I hate myself and VSCode looks boring... joking but I want to learn Linux so most of the code in this repository will be done from the command line) (projects that involve GUI will be done in windows with VSCode)
- Ubuntu Server - installed on a tiny PC. It will be used for any type of work done on this repository
- Windows + MobaXterm - to connect to the tiny PC remotely and follow courses from Udemy


### Courses Used from Udemy: 
- 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
- Replit - 100 Days of Python
- The Git & Github Bootcamp
- some course for Linux - pending ... 

### Certification Courses
