## My Personal Computer Science Bootcamp!

### Welcome to my own personal Bootcamp repository! 
This repository has been created specifically for me to help me learn computer science skills and improve my coding abilities or learn them as a beginner. I will start with the Git course, since it will cover the most basics of how to work around here (expect lots of commits in the first days). I already have an understanding of Python and Linux, so those two can wait for now.

### Tools:
- VIM - I will be using Vim as the main code editor (because I hate myself and VSCode looks boring... joking but I want to learn Linux so most of the code in this repository will be done from the command line) (projects that involve GUI will be done in windows with VSCode)
- Ubuntu Server - installed on a tiny PC. It will be used for any type of work done on this repository
- Windows + MobaXterm - to connect to the tiny PC remotely and follow courses from Udemy


### Courses Used from Udemy: 
- 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
- Replit - 100 Days of Python
- The Git & Github Bootcamp
- some course for Linux - pending ... 

### Certification Courses
