## My Personal Computer Science Bootcamp!

Welcome to my Computer Science Learning Repository! This repository is a collection of everything I've learned in the field of computer science, including coursework and certifications. While I am currently using Python to reinforce the concepts and theories I'm learning, my primary focus is on building a strong foundation in computer science.

### About Me
My name is Vlad, and I am an aspiring software developer. I am currently exploring various domains within computer science, with a focus on building a strong theoretical foundation. I am using Vim as my primary code editor, as I am interested in learning Linux and working from the command line.
