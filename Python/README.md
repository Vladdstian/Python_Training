## 100 Days of Udemy and Replit Courses

This folder contains my work for the 100 Days of Code challenge. I will use two courses side by side:  

### Courses

* Udemy - [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
* Replit - [100 Days of Python](https://replit.com/@Vladdstian)

### Work Updates

Each commit in this folder represents a day of my progress in the courses. I will use VIM as my main code editor in Ubuntu Linux server to get accustomed to Linux and GIT/GitHub. 
Occasionally, I will use Codespaces along with Visual Studio Code when I cannot use Linux because of the GUI or when I am not at home.


### Python Files
The folders here will be split into three sections:

- Beginner (day 1 to day 14)
- Intermediate (day 15 to day 57)
- Advanced topics (day 58 to day 100)
