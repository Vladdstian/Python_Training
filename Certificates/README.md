## My Completed Certificates

The certificates are valid, they have the links directly to Udemy website and they are uploaded here as a part of my training in Git/GitHub and Linux. Certificates are also downloaded directly from Linux and saved also as a pdf file. More certificates will be added to this repository as I continue my learning journey.
